                <p class="mb-4">This guide has been updated to reflect the latest version of ATMA. Here are the key changes:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg">
                    <li><strong>App Simplification:</strong> ATMA now exclusively uses the powerful <span class="key-term">Printed QR</span> method. The Digital QR mode has been removed to create a more focused and reliable experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Guided Setup:</strong> The settings screen will now automatically appear the first time you use the app, guiding you to create your mandatory <span class="key-term">Custom ID</span> before you can begin.</li>
                    <li><strong>New QR Generator Page:</strong> The "Download QR" button now takes you to a dedicated generator page. Here, you can preview the full newspaper article with your QR code and download it as a high-quality image, ready for printing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Full UI Language Support:</strong> The entire app interface, including all buttons, labels, and alerts, now correctly displays in either English or Indonesian based on your selection.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-3xl mb-4">Method</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">ATMA is a unique application designed to create a powerful and modern mentalism effect. The method is designed for situations where you use a <span class="key-term">pre-printed QR code</span> (e.g., on a business card or a mysterious photograph).</p>
                <p>As you present the choices to the spectator, the app sends those selections to an online database in *real-time* in the background. The QR code you have printed links to a special webpage that reads the data from the database to display a news article corresponding to the spectator's choices. This method requires an active internet connection on your phone during the performance.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-3xl mb-4">Settings Menu</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">To access the settings menu, simply <span class="key-term">tap the top-right corner</span> of the screen at any time. The first time you open the app, you will be required to set up your Custom ID. Inside, you will find the following options:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-lg">
                    <li><strong>Custom ID (Mandatory):</strong>
                        <ul class="list-['-_'] list-inside ml-6 mt-2 space-y-2">
                            <li>Set a unique, secret <span class="key-term">6-digit number</span>. This ID is crucial as it links your app to the database, creating your personal "channel" that the printed QR code will listen to.</li>
                            <li><strong>Change ID:</strong> You can change your ID at any time. <span class="key-term">Warning:</span> Changing your ID will render your old QR code non-functional. You must download and print the new QR code image to match the new ID.</li>
                            <li><strong>Download QR:</strong> Once an ID is saved, this button will open a new tab with the QR Code Generator page. On this page, you will see a preview of a newspaper article that contains your unique QR code. You can select the language for the article text and then use the download button on that page to save the complete article as a high-quality PNG image, ready to be printed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Delete ID:</strong> This button permanently removes the currently entered ID and its data from the database. Use with caution.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Language Selection:</strong> Choose between English and Indonesian. This changes the language of the revelation article that the spectator sees.</li>

            <!-- Input Method Section -->
            <section>
                <h2 class="text-3xl mb-4">Input Method</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">ATMA uses a clever gesture-based system to register choices. The method is designed to look natural and unsuspicious, as you perform it openly. The key lies in the <span class="key-term">STARTING AREA</span> of a single <span class="key-term">SWIPE LEFT</span> gesture.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">The screen is divided into five invisible zones. Where you begin your swipe determines which choice is registered. Since the spectator sees the app as a fullscreen photo gallery, swiping left is the most natural action to see the "next photo".</p>
                
                <div class="relative border-2 border-gray-800 bg-gray-200 my-6" style="aspect-ratio: 1/1;">
                    <!-- 2x2 grid background for swipe zones -->
                    <div class="grid grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2 h-full w-full">
                        <div class="gesture-cell bg-green-100/60"><strong>CHOICE 1</strong><span>(Start Swipe Left Here)</span></div>
                        <div class="gesture-cell bg-green-100/60"><strong>CHOICE 2</strong><span>(Start Swipe Left Here)</span></div>
                        <div class="gesture-cell bg-green-100/60"><strong>CHOICE 4</strong><span>(Start Swipe Left Here)</span></div>
                        <div class="gesture-cell bg-green-100/60"><strong>CHOICE 3</strong><span>(Start Swipe Left Here)</span></div>
                    </div>
                    <!-- Overlay for center tap zone -->
                    <div class="absolute top-[30%] left-[30%] w-[40%] h-[40%] p-1">
                         <div class="gesture-cell bg-green-100/90 border-2 border-black border-solid h-full w-full shadow-lg"><strong>CHOICE 5</strong><span>(Start Swipe Left Here)</span></div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p class="mt-6 italic text-gray-600">Note: A single, decisive swipe left is all that is required. After a valid gesture is registered, the app will automatically advance to the next screen.</p>

                    <li><strong>Pre-Show Setup:</strong> Before performing, open the app's Settings. Set your secret 6-digit <span class="key-term">Custom ID</span>. Click the <span class="key-term">Download QR</span> button, which will take you to the generator page. On this new page, select your desired language for the article's appearance and download the final image. Print this image (containing the QR code) on a business card, photograph, or other object.</li>
                    <li><strong>Introduce the Premise:</strong> Introduce the experiment. Present the lists of choices (Victim, Location, Weapon) to the spectator. Keep the object with the printed QR code hidden for now.</li>
                    <li><strong>Input Choices:</strong> As the spectator makes their choices, show them the corresponding list on your phone. To move to the next list, simply perform a <span class="key-term">SWIPE LEFT</span> gesture from the area corresponding to their choice. The action will look completely natural, as if you are just moving to the next photo in a gallery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Climax:</strong> After the third and final swipe, the app on your phone automatically updates the database. Now, reveal the pre-printed object (the business card, photo, etc.) and ask the spectator to scan the QR code. Their phone will open the news article, which will contain their freely chosen details. The final screen on your phone will show an image, perfect for misdirection.</li>

                    <li><strong>Reset App:</strong> To reset for a new performance, perform a <span class="key-term">quick triple-tap</span> on the final screen (the image). This action prepares the app for a new set of inputs.</li>
                    <li><strong>View Input History:</strong> To confirm your inputs, <span class="key-term">press and hold</span> your finger on the final screen. An overlay showing your registered choices will appear and will vanish when you lift your finger.</li>

                <h3 class="text-2xl mt-8 mb-4">Security & Plausibility</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">This feature is designed to protect the method if a spectator becomes suspicious and re-scans the QR code after the performance.</p>
                <p class="text-lg">
                    At the start of a performance, the app automatically sets your channel's status to "Performing". After the climax, perform a <span class="key-term">quick double-tap</span> on the final image screen. This sets your channel's status to "Not Performing" in the background. If the spectator re-scans the printed QR code later, the article will appear in a locked, static state, protecting the secret of the real-time update.
